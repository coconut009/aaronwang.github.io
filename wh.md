<h1>Ubuntu To Do List</h1>
I start using ubuntu since 2019, kinda fresh to the linux family
As a beginner like me, I highly recommend people to use this to do
list as a guide line. <br> I do hope it can help you 😁😁😁

<h4>There are couple things needs to do after a fresh ubuntu install</h4>

1. get **UPDATE** through Update Manager<br><br>
The most easy way to access the software update manager is by pressing superkey/ (windows key) <img src="https://easykey.uk/images/help/windows/windows-key.png" alt="Superkey" width="45"/><br>
and type _update_. <br><br>

Once the software starts running, it will check the updats for the current version of Ubuntu that need to be installed<br>
If it does find any, install these first and run Update Manager again if you need to restart your machine.<br>


2. make sure you have **ALL Graphic Drivers** <br><br>
Most of the drivers come pre-built in the linux kernel, due to the dependency on proprietary restricted products, <br> 
some of the graphic drivers need to be manually installed 😒😒😒 ==> Nvidia GPU Driver
