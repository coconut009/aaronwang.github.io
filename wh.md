<h1>Ubuntu To Do List</h1>
I start using ubuntu since 2019, kinda fresh to the linux family<br>
As a beginner like me, I highly recommend people to use this<br> to do
list as a guide line. I hope it can help you 😁😁😁 <br>

There are couple things needs to do after a fresh ubuntu install<br>
1. get UPDATE through Update Manager<br><br>

The most easy way to access the software update manager is by pressing superkey/(windows key)
